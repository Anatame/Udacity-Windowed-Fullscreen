A chrome extension that resizes course video player on udacity website to fit your browser's screen. You no longer have to make the video completely fullscreen for a comfortable viewing experience. 

**How to install?**
 - Download the project and just load the extension from the download directory.
 
 **How to use?**
 
 - Just click on the icon in the extensions section when on the udacity video course page and use the toggle button.
 *`Note: To get the player back to original size just refresh the page.`*

>   ***Why did I make this?***
> 
>  I was watching a course tutorial for Android Dev on Udacity and the video player was just uncomfortably small to see the code the instructor was explaining. So, I was like rather than suffer through this let's do something about it and then I made this..
